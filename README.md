# Veritas AI Agent - On-chain Auditor of Reputation and Facts

## Overview

Veritas is a decentralized AI agent that acts as an auditor for Web3 projects. It addresses the problem of misinformation, fraudulent claims, and hidden risks in the Web3 space by providing comprehensive trust scoring based on both on-chain and off-chain data analysis.

## Problem Statement

The Web3 space suffers from:
- **Misinformation**: Projects making false claims about partnerships or capabilities

## Solution

Veritas provides:
- **Comprehensive auditing**: Analysis of both on-chain and off-chain data sources
- **AI-powered insights**: Advanced pattern recognition and fraud detection
- **Trust scoring**: Confidence scores from 1-100 for easy decision making
- **Evidence-based reports**: Detailed breakdowns of positive factors and risks

```

#### Demo Mode
```bash
python main.py demo
```
Runs audits on sample well-known contracts to demonstrate functionality.

### Python API Usage

```python
import asyncio
from veritas_agent import VeritasAgent

async def audit_project():
    agent = VeritasAgent()
    
    # Audit a project
    score = await agent.audit_project("0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D")
    
    print(f"Trust Score: {score.overall_score}/100")
    print(f"Confidence: {score.confidence_level:.1%}")
    print(f"Risk Factors: {len(score.risk_factors)}")
    
    # Export detailed report
    report = agent.export_report(score)
    with open("audit_report.json", "w") as f:
        f.write(report)

# Run the audit
asyncio.run(audit_project())
```

                              Team Info   Recognition  + Detailed Report
```

## Scoring Algorithm

The trust score (1-100) is calculated using:

1. **Weighted Combination**:
   - On-chain score: 60% weight (more reliable)
   - Off-chain score: 40% weight

2. **On-Chain Factors**:
   - Contract verification (+20 points)
   - High transaction activity (+10 points)
   - Diverse user base (+10 points)
   - Security indicators (variable)
   - Risk factors (negative points)

3. **Off-Chain Factors**:
   - Positive social sentiment (+15 points)
   - Verified team members (+10 points)
   - Good media coverage (+10 points)
   - Active community engagement (+5 points)

4. **AI Analysis**:
   - Pattern recognition for fraud indicators
   - Confidence level assessment
   - Additional insights and recommendations
